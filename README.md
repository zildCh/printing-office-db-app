# ORM Hibernate for Database Applications

This project demonstrates the use of the **Hibernate ORM** technology in Java for developing database applications. It includes creating entity classes for a database model, defining mappings with annotations, and implementing a user interface for interacting with the data.

## Database Overview

The relational database used in this project represents a **typography system** and consists of the following 5 tables:
- **Contracts**
- **Address**
- **Orders**
- **Workshops**
- **Products**

## Key features

1. **Entity Classes:**  
   Develop a set of **entity classes** representing the database tables.  
   Mappings are implemented using **Hibernate annotations** for object-relational mapping.

2. **User Interface Features:**  
   A functional user interface is implemented to perform the following actions:
   - **View Records:** Display data from all tables in a user-friendly format.
   - **Add Records:** Add new entries to the database.
   - **Edit Records:** Update existing entries.
   - **Delete Records:** Remove entries from the database.
   - **Search Records:** Search across all fields, including partial matches, using **HQL (Hibernate Query Language)**.
